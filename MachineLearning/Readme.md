# Machine learning

-------------------

Dynamic dashboard built with pyplot and dynamic queries for opensearch, provides also an aggregation and EDA script for a DataFrame compilation for the players at the data source and Models built with RAPIDS and SciKit and their respective comparisons.

## Structure

- [Measures JSONS](JSONS): jsons with model performance on each platform.
- [EDA plots](imagesEDA): images generated with seaborn for player aggregation EDA.
- [Data Set](csv): Data Set aggregation and splits, for test reproducibility.
- [Scripts](../MachineLearning): scripts to generate DashBoard Aggregate players and benchmark ML models.
